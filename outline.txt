When is a != a in a program (python specifically)?

The expression a != a is not always true in programming.
Also the expression:  a == 1 and a == 2 and a == 3 can be true

This is can happen when the variable a is a shared resource 
with another program thread

1. Demonstrate problem code:  
   (a_not_eq_a.py)

2. Show disassembly of python code to explain whats happening
   (dis_a_not_eq_a.py)

3. Introduce the python thread lock to prevent this
   (dis_a_not_eq_a2.py)
